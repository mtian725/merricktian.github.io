Repository for my personal website. Hosted with **gethubpages**.

Things to do: <br />
-Add FIRE Project (add Unity to list) <br />
-Consider icons for the hyperlinks at the top banner <br />
-Add and link other contributors for projects <br />
-Style so that components look a bit nicer via shading, and editing colors, and ect. <br />
-Animate some components (consider adding jquery or bootstrap to do this) <br />
-Consider adding a traversal bar
