Repository for my personal website. Hosted with **gethubpages**.

Things to do: <br />
-Add FIRE Project (add Unity to list)

-Consider icons for the hyperlinks at the top banner

-Add and link other contributors for projects

-Style so that components look a bit nicer via shading, and editing colors, and ect.

-Animate some components (consider adding jquery or bootstrap to do this)

-Consider adding a traversal bar
